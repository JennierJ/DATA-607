## Netflix Scenario Design analysis

1) Who are your target users?

Netflix's target users are the people like watching shows and movies.

2) What are their key goals?

The goals of our users are to find the shows and movies they like.

3) How can you help them accomplish those goals? 

We can help users accomplish this goal by analyzing the browsing and watching history to recommend shows to watch.

## Reverse engineer

I have found a very good article talking about netflix recommender system "http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2850000/2843948/a13-gomez-uribe.pdf?ip=104.162.29.216&id=2843948&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2EE5B8A747884E71D5&CFID=926401650&CFTOKEN=39850565&__acm__=1492725389_f94fc5222e417790302bc634a41889d5"

## Recommendations

To improve the accuracy of recommendation system of Netflix, I think it will be a good idea to also recommend the shows by analyzing the locations, age, sex and edcuation etc. (to include more factors)
